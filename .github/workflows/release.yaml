            ## Quick Install (Recommended)

            To install the **latest** version of `huntsman`:
            ```bash
            curl -sL https://github.com/jturmel/huntsman/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
            ```

            To install **this specific version** (${{ github.ref_name }}):
            ```bash
            curl -sL https://github.com/jturmel/huntsman/releases/download/${{ github.ref_name }}/install.sh | VERSION=${{ github.ref_name }} bash
            ```

            The script will automatically detect your OS and architecture, download the binary, and set it up for you.
