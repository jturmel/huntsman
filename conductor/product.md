# Initial Concept
Huntsman is a TUI app that spiders a website and lists all the resources it finds within that domain.

## Target Users
- Web developers and SEO specialists looking to audit site resources.

## Goals
- Map out the entire resource hierarchy of a website for architectural analysis.
- Identify resources based on various criteria, such as finding broken links or missing resources (404s, etc.).

## Key Features
- Advanced filtering and sorting of the results table (e.g., by status code, file type, or depth).
- Exporting results to common formats like CSV, JSON, or Markdown for further analysis.
- Support for crawling client-side rendered (SPA) websites via headless browser mode.
- Real-time status updates and progress bars during the crawling process.
- Ability for users to pause, resume, or cancel a crawl in progress.
- A detailed view pane to inspect headers and metadata for a selected resource.
